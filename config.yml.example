### Sequence Statistics
sequence_stats_database: 'data/sequence.db' # The filename of the database which saves existing exposure history.
sequence_folder_path: None # [Optional] The folder name containing historical sequences. Bot will scan this folder only once to gather history. To force the whole scan again, just delete the database file, and it will be recreated automatically.
sequence_stats_config:
  # Possible values are: HFDPlot, ExposurePlot, GuidingPlot, MemoryHistoryPlot
  types: [ HFDPlot, ExposurePlot, GuidingPlot ]  # Select chart types of stats
  hfd_plot_max_shots_count: -1 # The max number of data points on HFD plot. Old images will be discarded when there's more exposure than this limit. -1 means no limit
  guiding_error_plot:
    max_shots_count: -1 # The max number of data points on Guiding error plot. Old error data will be discarded when there's more exposure than this limit. -1 means no limit
    unit: PIXEL # Valid values are PIXEL, ARCSEC
    scale: 1.21 # Arcsec for each pixel of your guiding camera + OTA. Voyager doesn't know this, you have to update this yourself.
    error_boundary: 2.5 # guiding error scatter chart will be limited to [-error_boundary, error_boundary] for both x and y axis. It doesn't care about unit (no auto converstion between pix and arcsec)
