## Introduction

`VoyagerTelegramBot` is a lightweight client of Voyager Application Server. Unlike the
official [Web Dashboard](https://www.starkeeper.it/wdashinfo/),
`VoyagerTelegramBot` focuses on generating statistical charts and forwarding necessary messages
to [Telegram](https://telegram.org/).

With `VoyagerTelegramBot`, you don't need to keep a dashboard open to monitor the imaging session for sub-images, system
status, and critical warning and errors.

## Full Installation Guide

Please refer to [Full Installation guide](doc/full_installation.md)

## Virus? Nah, you are safe(most likely)

For easier distribution purpose, we used [pyinstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller) to create a
standalone .exe file to save the hassle of unzipping the code, installing a compatible version of python, then 
install all the dependencies.

However, due to the fact that pyinstaller needs to extract all the content to a temporary folder and starts a python 
process, some antivirus programs might think it's an unsafe behavior, and blocks the app from running.

We are confident that our releases are clean and don't contain malicious code. However, as a disclaimer, we are **NOT** 
responsible for any possible harm and loss this bot might cause.

The false alarms for exe files built by pyinstaller is a known issue, and there's no easy way to totally get rid of it
